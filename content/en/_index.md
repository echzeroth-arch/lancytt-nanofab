### What we do

- **Characterize** materials and nanostructures using electron microscopy (SEM / ESEM).  
- **Define and fabricate** micro- and nanoscale structures through **EBL** and nanofabrication workflows.  
- **Train researchers and students** through technical internships, thesis projects, and progressive hands-on training.
