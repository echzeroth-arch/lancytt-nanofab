### What we do

- **Characterize** materials and nanostructures using electron microscopy (SEM / ESEM).  
- **Design and fabricate** micro- and nano-metric structures using **EBL** and controlled nanofabrication processes.  
- **Train talent** through research stays, thesis projects, and progressive technical training, with a strong emphasis on experimental rigor.
