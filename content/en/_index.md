## Scientific focus

**LANCYTT Advanced NanoFab** supports scientific research at the intersection of **nanofabrication**, **electron microscopy**, and **functional materials**, with emphasis on **physical understanding of processes** and **experimental validation**.

The platform is conceived not as a single-topic laboratory, but as an **enabling infrastructure** for diverse research directions.
