## Electron microscopy

### SEM / ESEM (Scanning Electron Microscopy)
Capabilities for morphological, structural, and compositional-contrast analysis across a wide range of materials.

**Typical applications**
- Surface morphology and topography
- Comparative analysis between processes or batches
- Defect and failure inspection
- Imaging under controlled environmental conditions (ESEM)

**General features**
- High-vacuum and variable-pressure modes
- Secondary and backscattered electron detection
- Support for conductive and non-conductive samples

**Status**
- Operational / under progressive recovery (equipment-dependent)

## Lithography and nanofabrication

### Electron-beam lithography (E-beam)
Platform for high-resolution micro- and nano-pattern definition.

**Typical applications**
- Device patterning
- Nanostructure prototyping
- Mask fabrication and process testing

---

### Nanoimprint lithography
Capability for pattern replication using nanoimprint techniques.

**Typical applications**
- Nanostructure replication
- Metasurfaces and periodic patterns
- Rapid prototyping from master molds

## Supporting processes

Depending on project scope and equipment status, the platform may provide:
- Basic sample preparation
- Cleaning and handling processes
- Integration with characterization workflows

> Some processes are enabled **progressively** and require prior technical evaluation.

---

## Access and usage

Infrastructure access is granted through:
- Formal project request
- Technical feasibility assessment
- Scheduling based on availability
- Compliance with safety and operational protocols

Usage priority is generally assigned to:
1. Academic research and training projects  
2. Scientific collaborations  
3. Selected technology-oriented projects
