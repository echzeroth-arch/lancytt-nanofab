## Overview
Our infrastructure integrates tools for **fabrication, processing, and characterization** at the micro- and nanoscale.

## Electron microscopy
- SEM / ESEM (morphology, microstructure, compositional contrast)
- Sample preparation (TBD)

## Lithography and nanofabrication
- Electron-beam lithography
- Nanoimprint lithography
- Supporting processes (TBD)

## Status and availability
This section is evolving. For specific equipment details or capabilities, please contact us.
