## Scanning electron microscopy (SEM / FESEM)

Service for morphological and structural surface characterization at micro- and nanoscale.

**General capabilities:**
- Surface morphology imaging
- High-vacuum operation
- Compatibility with conductive or properly prepared samples
- Typical accelerating voltages between **1 and 30 kV**
- Resolution down to the **nanometer scale**, depending on configuration

This service is suitable for studies of materials, devices, coatings, nanostructures, and heterogeneous systems.

## Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX)

Elemental compositional analysis integrated with electron microscopy.

**General capabilities:**
- Qualitative and semi-quantitative elemental identification
- Point analysis or region-based analysis
- Direct integration with SEM/FESEM imaging
- Requires samples compatible with vacuum conditions

EDX analysis complements morphological studies with localized chemical information.

## Electron-beam lithography (EBL)

**Nanofabrication** service for the definition of micro- and nanoscale patterns.

**General capabilities:**
- Direct-write electron-beam patterning
- Use of electron-sensitive resists (e.g., PMMA)
- Definition of micro- and nanoscale structures
- Applications in research prototypes, devices, and proof-of-concept studies

Electron-beam lithography is offered with an **academic and experimental focus**, and is not intended for industrial-scale production.

## Thickness measurement

Thickness measurement service for planar samples.

**General capabilities:**
- Measurements in the millimeter range
- Micrometer-level precision
- Instrumentation with certified calibration

Suitable for coatings, thin films, and structured materials.

---

## Training and technical support

Depending on project scope, services may include:
- Initial equipment training
- Guided experimental sessions
- Best-practice documentation

> Not all services imply **direct user operation**.  
> The access scheme is defined case by case.

## How to request a service

Service requests should include the following information:

1. Project objective  
2. Sample or material type  
3. Required technique (SEM/FESEM, EDX, electron-beam lithography, thickness measurement)  
4. Expected output (images, spectra, patterns, measurements)  
5. Approximate timeline  

Based on this information, we typically perform:
- Technical evaluation
- Scope definition
- Tentative scheduling

## Service priority

Priority is generally assigned as follows:
1. Internal academic projects  
2. Undergraduate and graduate theses  
3. External scientific collaborations  
4. Selected technology-oriented projects  

---

## General considerations

Service availability depends on:
- technical compatibility of the samples,
- operational status of the infrastructure,
- and institutional priorities.
