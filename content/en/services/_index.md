## General approach

**LANCYTT Advanced NanoFab** provides specialized services in **electron microscopy**, **nanofabrication**, and **lithography**, primarily oriented toward **academic projects**, **advanced training**, and **technology-oriented collaborations**.

Services are offered under a **technical guidance model**, emphasizing problem definition, experimental feasibility, and operational safety.

## Electron microscopy

### SEM / ESEM

Characterization services for morphological and structural analysis of materials and devices.

**Typical scope**
- Surface and topographical inspection
- Process or treatment comparison
- Defect and failure identification
- Micro- and nano-structure documentation

**Service modes**
- Single-session observation
- Comparative studies
- Support for thesis or publication results

> Basic technical guidance for image interpretation is included.

## Nanofabrication and lithography

### Electron-beam lithography
Support for pattern definition and process testing.

**Possible services**
- Design (layout) review
- Basic parameter definition
- Execution of critical process steps (project-dependent)

---

### Nanoimprint lithography
Services focused on pattern replication and prototyping.

**Possible services**
- Replication tests
- Mold evaluation
- Basic parameter tuning

---

## Training and technical support

Depending on project scope, services may include:
- Initial equipment training
- Guided experimental sessions
- Best-practice documentation

> Not all services imply **direct user operation**.  
> The access scheme is defined case by case.

## How to request a service

Service requests should include the following information:

1. Project objective  
2. Sample or material type  
3. Required technique (SEM/ESEM, lithography, nanoimprint)  
4. Expected output (images, patterns, tests)  
5. Approximate timeline  

Based on this information, we perform:
- Technical evaluation
- Scope definition
- Tentative scheduling

---

## Service priority

Priority is generally assigned as follows:
1. Internal academic projects  
2. Undergraduate and graduate theses  
3. External scientific collaborations  
4. Selected technology-oriented projects

## Important note

**LANCYTT Advanced NanoFab** services are not intended as standard commercial services, but as **specialized technical support** within an academic and collaborative environment.
