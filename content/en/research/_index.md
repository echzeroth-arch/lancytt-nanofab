## Nanohybridization of plasmonic nanostructures

This research line focuses on the **design, fabrication, and functionalization of plasmonic nanostructures**, integrating electron-beam lithography and chemical synthesis for the development of **multiplatform molecular diagnostics**.

The goal is to develop advanced systems for the **detection of biomarkers associated with non-communicable diseases**, through controlled nano-assembly strategies and optimization of optical response.
