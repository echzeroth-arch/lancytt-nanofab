## Training philosophy

**LANCYTT Advanced NanoFab** is a platform for **advanced technical and scientific training**, aimed at students seeking to develop real skills in **nanofabrication**, **electron microscopy**, and rigorous experimental work.

Training goes beyond equipment operation and includes:
- physical understanding of processes
- experimental best practices
- result analysis and documentation

---

## Training modalities

### Undergraduate students

- Short introductory stays
- Experimental support projects
- Internships and professional practice

**Recommended profile**
- Genuine interest in experimental science
- Responsibility and discipline
- Willingness to learn protocols and safety rules

---

### Master’s and PhD students

- Thesis projects
- Process and methodology development
- Advanced characterization
- Support for scientific publications

**Expectation**
Students are actively involved in:
- experimental planning
- controlled execution
- critical analysis of results

---

### Specialized technical training

Depending on project scope and availability:
- Equipment operation training
- Progressive access (observer → operator)
- Protocol documentation

> Access to advanced equipment is **gradual** and performance-dependent.

---

## Recommended learning path

A typical training progression follows:

**Learn → Operate → Document → Optimize → Teach**

This approach ensures:
- operational safety
- reproducibility
- knowledge transfer

---

## How to apply

To request a training stay or project, please provide:

1. Academic level and program
2. Technical or scientific interests
3. Time availability
4. Expected outcome (thesis, training, technical support)

Acceptance depends on:
- thematic alignment
- infrastructure availability
- technical supervision capacity
