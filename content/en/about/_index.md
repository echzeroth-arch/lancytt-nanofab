## What is LANCYTT Advanced NanoFab?

**LANCYTT Advanced NanoFab** is a specialized platform for **nanofabrication**, **lithography**, and **advanced electron microscopy**, supporting **academic research**, **specialized training**, and **scientific-technological collaborations**.

The platform operates within **LANCYTT – CIACYT, UASLP** (San Luis Potosí, Mexico) as enabling infrastructure for projects requiring experimental control, high-resolution characterization, and technical capability development.

---

## Mission

To strengthen research and advanced training through rigorous and responsible use of **micro/nanofabrication** and **electron microscopy** infrastructure, enabling national and international collaborations.

---

## What distinguishes us

- **Experimental rigor and traceability**: emphasis on reproducibility, documentation, and best practices.  
- **Technical guidance**: support to define scope, feasibility, and realistic deliverables.  
- **Progressive training**: level-based access (observer → operator) under safety protocols.  
- **Enabling focus**: the platform supports diverse research lines rather than a single-topic agenda.

## How we operate

Access is granted through:
1. **Short request** (objective, sample, requested technique, expected output)  
2. **Technical evaluation** (feasibility and scope)  
3. **Scheduling** based on availability and priority  
4. **Execution and delivery** according to the agreed scheme

Priority is generally assigned to:
- academic and training projects  
- scientific collaborations  
- selected technology-oriented projects
